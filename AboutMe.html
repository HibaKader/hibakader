<p><a href=""></a><br>My name is Hiba Kader, I am a sophomore student at Madison Academic with all honors classes. I was born and raised in Jackson, Tennessee.</br><br> I am originally from the country Palestine. I am a bilingual, meaning I can speak 2 languages.</br> Something a little different about me is that I enjoy learning another language, and a fun fact about me is that I can say my alphabet backwards quickly. I have a passion for photography, in my free time I enjoy taking photographs of nature and other things. Also, I know how to knit, in middle school for art class I would sometimes have to knit things for a grade. I enjoy running, I was on the track team freshman year. Finally, I was a specialist in Dev catalyst for creating a website.</p>
