      <h2>Why so serious?</h2>
      <p><a href="https://goo.gl/images/E9WNm5">Blue</a> is one of my favorite colors because it's the color of the ocean and sky which is beautiful. My second favorite color is <a href="https://goo.gl/images/5Cpvmh">black</a> because it matches all my outifts. My third favorite color is <a href="https://goo.gl/images/StgKDr">purple</a> because it's the color of my room and it's really pretty.</p>
